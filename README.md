What I Did:

Going into this assignment I wanted to do a topic that would serve a better purpose for society while still being able to have fun in CSS and HTML. As you know by know I settled with Distracted/Texting and Driving and thought it would be the perfect topic. I see so many people throughout my life even family members pulling out a phone while driving and its scary. You may say that you can still drive but it takes one accident to realize that mistake and you might not get another chance.

Creating this website for my IMD1005 Web Development assignment was pretty fun. I am still understanding HTML and CSS but so far I am enjoying it. I made use of the animations and hover actions that occur when you hover over the titles and quotes. I even learned and added a parallax to the pages to give that cool stationary road effect while you scroll down. I also made the navbar unique by having it appear at the bottom on the main page untill you scroll past the header and it will stick to the top.

Going into the Requirements I have used !DOCTYPE, html, head, body, header, footers, main, nav, a, h1, 3 p's, and 3 pages. For index.html, my other tags are h2, ol, ul, and pre. For about.html, my other tags are h2, h3, ul, i, and pre. For contact.html, my other tags are h2, i, b, and pre. I also included the images with proper naming.



What Challenges:

One challenge I encountered was topic because it took a alot of time in the process of making the website. Its very important to have a good topic to know and build a website off of so that way you can showcase your knowledge effectively.

Another challenge was just time allocation. I would spend so much time on the main page that the quality is noticably reduced on the other two pages. In my opinion I think I did great but if I properly put the time equally among the other pages it would look far more consistent.



Things I Hope To Learn:

Javascript is a big one. I learned a small amount in Ali Aryas IMD1000 class but I want to further my understanding to be able to create fully functional websites from scratch.Like one thing I wanted to do before making this was to have a car on the screen and as you scroll  it drives along but then crashes at one point. I then realized that would require javascript to be able to do scrolling related actions so I then improvised.

Another basic thing is just better and web development and design. Being able to make a site not only function properly but look clean and have a nice style to it.



Conclusion:

Overall I am happy with my first website in this class. Still learning but ready to get better and improve. BTW the thing I am considering "exceptional" (at least to me) was using parallax and having that effect with the navbar throughout the website. ðŸ˜„
